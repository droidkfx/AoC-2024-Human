# AoC (Advent of Code) 2024
This repository is a log of my solutions in the 2024 advent of code competition. I will strive not to push complete solutions till a day after the problem opens to keep the competition fair.

There is a sister repository that exists where I am interested in seeing how useful LLMs are in this space. I am letting it compete as well. Check that out [here](https://github.com/droidkfx/AoC-2024-CoPilot).
